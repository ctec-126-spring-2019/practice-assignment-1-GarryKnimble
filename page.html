            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I am a person who is excited to learn new things in the technology sphere. 
                I have been programming for a while, though I didn't really hone in on important programming concepts until college. 
                From there, I've been focusing on web development. After a while, I decided that web development was something I wanted to do for my career.</p>
            <h2>What I Want to Accomplish</h2>
            <p>
                In this class, I hope to gain some knowledge and insights into proper JavaScript programming. At the end of the course, I want to be able to apply
                what I learned to what I will be doing in my career.
            </p>
            <h2>My Knowledge of Programming</h2>
            <p>
                I have been programming for a bit using languages such as Python. I do have knowledge of theoretical aspects of programming, such as data structures.
                I have either familiarity or experience in the following languages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python 3 (Experience)</li>
                <li>C# (Familiarity)</li>
                <li>JavaScript (Familiarity)</li>
                <li>C (Familiarity)</li>
                <li>PHP (Familiarity)</li>
                <li>Java (Familiarity)</li>
            </ul>
